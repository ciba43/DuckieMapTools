# Duckie Map Tools

Map compiler tools for the Duckie Game Engine. Processes maps created in an map editor (like Valve Hammer Editor or J.A.C.K.) into a format that the engine uses

## Common Features

- Class-based representation of Brushes, Entities, Planes and Polygons
- `.map` version 220 (Half-Life 1) parser
- Tests to check if the tools are functional and haven't regressed
- Builds only on Windows at the moment (but should build on Linux as well with some care)

## DuckCSG Features

- Can parse maps
- Sets up brushes
- Generates polygons from brushes
